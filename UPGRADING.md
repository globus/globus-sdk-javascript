# Upgrading

## Migrating from `v3` to `v4`

The `v4` release of `@globus/sdk` addresses a number of issues related to the CommonJS and ESM bundle exports. Prior to this relases, many environments **required** the use of the CommonJS bundle (even when ESM was supported).

In addition to bundle improvements, the `v4` release moves to using the native [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) for cryptographic operations during the OAuth2 PKCE (when using the `AuthorizationManager`). Based on the async nature of the Web Crypto API, many methods of the `AuthorizationManager` now return Promises.

### Breaking Changes

#### Package Entry Points

The distributed `package.json` file has been overhauled to better align with the intended use of the package, and build and runtime environment expectations for sourcing modules.

From an implementation standpoint, this means you should no longer need to explicitly reference the `cjs` or `esm` directories in your path references.

```diff
-import { isConsentRequiredError } from "@globus/sdk/cjs/lib/core/errors";
+import { isConsentRequiredError } from "@globus/sdk/core/errors";
```

_NOTE: The change above also reflects the removal of the `lib` directory mentioned below._

#### `lib` Directory Removed

The `lib` directory has been removed and should no longer be used in path references.

```diff js
-import { endpointManager } from '@globus/sdk/esm/lib/services/transfer';
+import { endpointManager } from '@globus/sdk/services/transfer';
```

#### ESM

Explicit `@globus/sdk/cjs/*` references were being used to avoid issues with the ESM package (mainly incompatible exports). If your build environment does not require you to use CommonJS, most path references can be swapped with their ESM counterpart by removing `/cjs/lib`.

```diff js
-import { endpointManager } from '@globus/sdk/cjs/lib/services/transfer';
+import { endpointManager } from '@globus/sdk/services/transfer';
```

#### CommonJS

We are still committed to supporting CommonJS environments, but the number of entrypoints has been reduced. We believe this decision better reflects the intended usage of the CommonJS package and the fact the the entrypoints **will bundle all required code** to make the entrypoint viable â€“ having deep entrypoints for individual service methods doesn't seem useful at this time.

```js
const sdk = require('@globus/sdk');
```

Or, explicity:

```js
const sdk = require('@globus/sdk/cjs');
```

#### `AuthorizationManager`

In order to support the use of the native [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), many methods of the `AuthorizationManager` now return Promises, impacted methods include:

- `AuthorizationManager.login()`
- `AuthorizationManager.handleErrorResponse()`
- `AuthorizationManager.handleAuthorizationRequirementsError()`
- `AuthorizationManager.handleConsentRequiredError()`

See the [`AuthorizationManager` documentation](https://globus.github.io/globus-sdk-javascript/classes/Authorization.AuthorizationManager.html) for full details.
